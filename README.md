# Arabic Text Classification with NLP 

## Overview
This project aims to perform Arabic text classification using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). The project involves collecting data from various Arabic websites, preprocessing the data, building RNN-based models, and evaluating their performance using standard classification metrics.

## Data Collection
### Web Scraping
We utilize web scraping libraries such as Scrapy or BeautifulSoup to gather text data from various Arabic websites on a specific topic.

### Dataset Preparation
We construct a dataset with columns for text and corresponding scores (0 to 10) indicating the relevance of each text.

## NLP Preprocessing Pipeline
### Tokenization
We implement tokenization to break down text into individual words or subwords.

### Stemming and Lemmatization
We apply stemming and lemmatization to reduce words to their base or root form.

### Stop Words Removal
We eliminate common stop words from the text data.

### Discretization
We convert the continuous score values to discrete categories if needed.

## Model Training
We build models using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Bidirectional RNN, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architectures.

### Hyperparameter Tuning
We fine-tune hyperparameters for each model to optimize performance.

## Model Evaluation
### Standard Metrics
We evaluate models using standard classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

### BLEU Score
We employ BLEU score, a metric commonly used in machine translation, to evaluate the quality of generated text against reference text.

## Summary
This project involves collecting Arabic text data, preparing a dataset with relevance scores, implementing an NLP preprocessing pipeline, and training RNN-based models. Evaluation is performed using standard classification metrics along with BLEU score for a comprehensive assessment of model performance on the Arabic text classification task.
